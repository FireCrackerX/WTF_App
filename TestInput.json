        "description": "With the fresh aromatic ingredients used in South East Asian curries, I'll always be an advocate of making the curry pastes from scratch because it’s not possible to capture that flavour in jars. But it’s just not viable to do that every time I have a hankering for curry.",
        "ingredients": "Coconut milk  full fat please! Fat is where the flavour is, if you use low fat coconut milk the sauce will lack flavour. You could even use coconut cream, if you want a richer version! Chicken or vegetable broth  chicken is better (deeper flavours) but vegetable is fine if making a vegetarian version.",
